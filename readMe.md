source code management life cycle for collaborative software development and provide an example for 
each stage of the life cycle.

The source code management life cycle for collaborative software development begins with planning
 and requirements gathering using tools like Jira or Trello. Developers then write and modify code u
sing IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA, while utilizing Git for version control, branching, 
and merging changes. Code reviews are conducted via pull requests on platforms like GitHub or GitLab, ensuring code quality. 
Automated CI/CD pipelines, configured with tools like Jenkins or CircleCI, handle continuous integration, testing, and deployment. 
Release management involves versioning with SemVer, preparing release notes, and scheduling deployments with tools like Ansible or Kubernetes. 
Maintenance and support are ongoing, utilizing issue tracking systems such as Bugzilla or Jira for bug fixes and updates.
